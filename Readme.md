# Mastodon integration for Sopel IRC Bot

## TODOs
- write proper Readme.me
- reply to toots which are not found via mention system
  - might involve "importing" toots based on link/id
  - link importing could become dangerous
- Check possibillity of:
  - Config/User changable delays for notification updates
  - Something I forgot?
- Clarify with "Team"
  - How should Notifications be displayed?
  - Which users should have toot/anonymous/delete-permission?
